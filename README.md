"Getting it Done"
>> A collection of advice that I find valuable guidance as I and my team try to be increasingly effective.
>>NOTE: These aren't primarily original ideas - some are sourced from reading or TED talks, some via advice from colleagues or observation.  I've tried to cite sources where I know them, but I think there must be some that I've missed because I don't know the original source.
